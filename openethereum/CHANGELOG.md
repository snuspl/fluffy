## OpenEthereum [v3.0.0](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

OpenEthereum v3.0.0 is the first release of OpenEthereum client as part of OpenEthereum project, divested from Parity Technologies.

This release marks the transition from Parity Technologies infrastructure and bootnodes to the one managed by OpenEthereum project.

Parity-Ethereum v2.7 users can continue using their existing data folders. Command-line interface has also stayed identical.
Unless specified otherwise, OpenEthereum v3.0.0 will detect if the user's database in the old Parity-Ethereum default path,
and only if it's not found will write to the new default location.

This release includes several major improvements to network and database stack:
- Support for `eth/64` protocol and Node Discovery v4 `Ethereum Node Records` extension.
- Accounts bloom is removed which should decrease the database size.

**Due to database changes this is a one-way upgrade. Please back up your database if you plan to continue using Parity-Ethereum v2.7.2.**

Note that this release drops support for IPFS and `eth/62` protocol. Additionally, it marks light client, private transactions and updater as deprecated features which may be removed in a future release.
