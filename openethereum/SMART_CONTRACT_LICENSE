SMART CONTRACT LICENSE v1.0


Anyone may run, modify, publicly perform, distribute and redistribute this
software, and create derivative works based on it in each case in compliance
with the permissions granted by the document (“Permissions Document”) whose
**KECCAK256 HASH** equals the value found in the PUBLICLY READABLE VARIABLE
named permissionsDocumentHash  on the **ETHEREUM MAINNET** **SMART CONTRACT
ACCOUNT** with the following ADDRESS 0x5a88CA36Fd58Efde3b955758285E8e3347D1eAe3
which is deemed incorporated into this license by reference. In case of any
conflicts between this license and the Permissions Document, this license shall
prevail.


Where:
- KECCAK256 HASH is the cryptographic hash algorithm that may take any document,
expressed as a series of bytes, and convert it to a single value which may be
expressed as a number from 0 to `2**256`;
- ETHEREUM MAINNET is the peer-to-peer blockchain network and shared account
ledger initiated and recognised by the Ethereum Foundation as "Ethereum";
- SMART CONTRACT ACCOUNT is a single account to be found on the ETHEREUM MAINNET
identified by an ADDRESS and which represents the combination of a computer
programme and some associated values;
- ADDRESS is a number between 0 and `2**160`, which is the primary means of
identifying a single account on the ETHEREUM MAINNET;
- PUBLICLY READABLE VARIABLE is an item in a smart contract storage, publicly
accessible via the smart contract’s ABI using a getter function matching its
name.

This license supplements and does not replace any other license pertaining to
this software.

No permissions are granted if no **KECCAK256 HASH** appears in the *ETHEREUM
MAINNET** **SMART CONTRACT ACCOUNT**.

This license takes effect as a bare licence, and has the effect of granting
rights to each licensee (which may be subject to conditions), BUT IMPOSES NO
OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITY ON ANY LICENSOR, ANY OWNER OF RIGHTS IN THE SOFTWARE,
OR ANY PERSON INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND CODING OF THE SOFTWARE
(“GRANTOR”).

Each Grantor shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability
for direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or
other damages of any character including, without limitation, procurement of
substitute software or services, loss of use, data or profits, or business
interruption, however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort
(including negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way in
relation to the supply, licensing or operation of the software, even if advised
of the possibility of such damages.
