//! Account state
//! This crate contains code used to create, convert, and update Accounts and the code and storage
//! associated with it. It also defines the trait used to construct a backend to build a complete
//! caching state database.
//! Note: the code that needs access to `ethcore` types such as `Machine` and `Executive` is found in
//! the `executive_state` module in `ethcore`. Most tests for the `State` module in this crate are
//! also found in `executive_state` (for the same reason).
