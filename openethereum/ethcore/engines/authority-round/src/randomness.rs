//! On-chain randomness generation for authority round
//!
//! This module contains the support code for the on-chain randomness generation used by AuRa. Its
//! core is the finite state machine `RandomnessPhase`, which can be loaded from the blockchain
//! state, then asked to perform potentially necessary transaction afterwards using the `advance()`
//! method.
//!
//! No additional state is kept inside the `RandomnessPhase`, it must be passed in each time.
//!
//! The process of generating random numbers is a simple finite state machine:
//!

//!
//! Phase transitions are performed by the smart contract and simply queried by the engine.
//!
//! Randomness generation works as follows:
//! * During the commit phase, all validators locally generate a random number, and commit that number's hash to the
//!   contract.
//! * During the reveal phase, all validators reveal their local random number to the contract. The contract should
//!   verify that it matches the committed hash.
//! * Finally, the XOR of all revealed numbers is used as an on-chain random number.
//!
//! An adversary can only influence that number by either controlling _all_ validators who committed, or, to a lesser
//! extent, by not revealing committed numbers.
//! The length of the commit and reveal phases, as well as any penalties for failure to reveal, are defined by the
//! contract.
//!
//! A typical case of using `RandomnessPhase` is:
//!
//! 1. `RandomnessPhase::load()` the phase from the blockchain data.
//! 2. Call `RandomnessPhase::advance()`.
//!
//! A production implementation of a randomness contract can be found here:
