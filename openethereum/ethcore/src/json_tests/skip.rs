//! State or blockchain tests to skip.
//!
//! Looks in the `ethereum/tests/test-issues/currents.json` file. This file contains two
//! collections, `block` and `state`, each with a different format to specify single tests to skip.
//!
//! To skip a blockchain test, add a JSON object to the `block` array, where `failing` names the
//! leaf folder with the tests to skip. The `subtests` array contains the names of the tests to skip.
//! Note that this does not handle duplicate folder names, e.g. `ValidBlocks/funTests/` and
//! `Something/funTests` would both be matched when `failing` is set to `funTests`.
//!
//! To skip a state test, add a JSON object to the `state` array. The `failing` works like for block
//! tests, but the `subtests` key is an object on the form:
//! "testName": {"subnumbers": [INDEX_OF_SKIPPED_SUBTESTS | "*"], "chain": "Blockchain name (informational)"}`
//!
//! Use the `reference` key to point to the github issue tracking to solution to the problem.
//!
//! Note: the `declare_test!` macro can also be use to skip tests, but skips entire files rather
//! than single tests.
